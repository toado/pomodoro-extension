A personal twist on the tradtional pomodoro technique -- 40-60 mins of focus, ~20 mins of break (Perfect for just about any episode to watch!). 

In my experiences with the traditional version (25/5), it is excruciatingly difficult to grind out studying for on hours on end with a mere 5 min break in between, so to combat that, just work a little longer to justify a break. It really is just another variation of pomodoro to fit personal needs (you can tailor it to what you see best fit anyway). Most of my assignments required more than 25 mins to get the flow going, so it just made sense this way. 

While these type of projects already exist, I just wanted to learn about how to create and my very own extension onto Firefox (& Chrome?).
